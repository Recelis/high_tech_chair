# high_tech_chair

This is an Arduino attached to a chair that uses a force sensor to detect whether someone is sitting on it. If they are, it begins a looping Pomodorro cycle. Fortunately, this functionality turns off with the help of a button. Will give you 25 minutes of work making you sit in the chair by beeping if you are not, and 5 minutes of rest where it beeps if you are sitting on the chair.
